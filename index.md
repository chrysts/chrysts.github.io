## Sometimes Working on AI

Christian Simon

Hi, I am a PhD student in the Australian National University starting in 2018.
My research problem focuses on meta-learning, life-long learning, continual-learning, and their applications. 

I incline to solve and describe the problems from these perspectives: representation learning, optimization, and geometry.
